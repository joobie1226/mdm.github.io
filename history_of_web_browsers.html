        <h2>How Web Browsers Work</h2>
        <p> Web browsers are essential to the process of connecting users to the World Wide Web and allowing them to have access to everything the internet has to offer. They are software that, using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an internet connection, allows the user to access information such as images, text, and videos (Telefonica). The way browsers work is they receive data from servers and interpret it into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code (Telefonica). HTML code is the universal language programmers use to design websites, allowing the user to see the content they searched for to be displayed on whatever device they are using. When a user types a URL into a web browser, the browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the domain name into an IP address, that IP address is linked to a web server, to which the browser sends a request (geeksforgeeks). The web server will process the request and will relay the information back to the browser, which will then display the information through a webpage for the user to see (geeksforgeeks).</p>
