        <h2>How Web Browsers Work</h2>
        <p> Web browsers are essential to the process of connecting users to the World Wide Web and allowing them to have access to everything the internet has to offer. They are software that, using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an internet connection, allows the user to access information such as images, text, and videos (Telefonica). The way browsers work is they receive data from servers and interpret it into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code (Telefonica). HTML code is the universal language programmers use to design websites, allowing the user to see the content they searched for to be displayed on whatever device they are using. When a user types a URL into a web browser, the browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the domain name into an IP address, that IP address is linked to a web server, to which the browser sends a request (geeksforgeeks). The web server will process the request and will relay the information back to the browser, which will then display the information through a webpage for the user to see (geeksforgeeks).</p>

        <h2>The Beginnings of Web Browsers</h2>
        <p> Web browsers date to the late 1990s when a hypertext computer scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee created the first web server and browser called the World Wide Web (Telefonica). When Lee created the World Wide Web, it failed to become popular and was not widely used. This was due to it being sophisticated for its time and only working on workstations located at NeXt Computer Inc. In the decade that followed the creation of the World Wide Web, various web browsers were invented, each one with its own unique user interface. In 1993, at the University of Illinois in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a second web browser was created, and it was named Mosaic. It was designed by Marc Andreessen and his team at the NCSA and became the first popular web browser, spreading the use and knowledge of web browsing across the globe (livinginternet). At first, Mosaic only worked on Unix computers, but several months after its launch, versions of the browser were created for the Windows and Mac operating systems, making Mosaic the first browser with cross-platform support (livinginternet). The features that Mosaic provided made it more appealing to users who weren’t tech-savvy and increased its popularity among everyday people. Some of those features included bookmarking URLs, history files for URLs, support for graphics, sound, videos, as well as icon buttons that allowed the user to go backward or forward between web pages they had previously looked up.  In the year that followed its creation, the commercial rights for Mosaic were assigned to Spyglass, Inc., an internet software company in Illinois. With Microsoft starting to develop its own web browser and some of the developers of Mosaic shifting their focus to create Netscape, the NCSA decided to stop the development of its web browser in 1997.    </p>
